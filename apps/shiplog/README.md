> Review evidence loop for people who need receipts, not review prose.

shiplog turns work evidence into a review-readiness loop: diagnose setup,
collect receipts, inspect status, repair gaps, rerun, compare, and share
safely.

## Install

```bash
cargo install shiplog --locked
```

With optional LLM-assisted workstream clustering:

```bash
cargo install shiplog --locked --features llm
```

Prerequisites: Rust 1.95+. Token-backed sources use environment variables such
as `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `JIRA_TOKEN`, or `LINEAR_API_KEY`; local git,
JSON, and manual evidence can run without provider tokens.

## What you get

| Surface | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Setup preflight | `shiplog doctor --setup` |
| Agent setup state | `shiplog doctor --setup --json` |
| Review-loop status | `shiplog status --latest` |
| Agent review state | `shiplog status --latest --json` |
| Evidence intake | `shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain` |
| Repair queue | `shiplog repair plan --latest` |
| Local journal repair | `shiplog journal add --from-repair <repair_id>` |
| Repair movement | `shiplog repair diff --latest` |
| Packet movement | `shiplog runs diff --latest` |
| Share posture | `shiplog share explain manager --latest` |

## First useful loop

Start with setup and status:

```bash
shiplog init --guided
shiplog doctor --setup
shiplog sources status
shiplog doctor --setup --json
shiplog status --latest
```

Collect the first packet:

```bash
shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain
shiplog status --latest
```

Repair and compare when status says the packet needs evidence:

```bash
shiplog repair plan --latest
shiplog journal add --from-repair <repair_id>
shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain
shiplog repair diff --latest
shiplog runs diff --latest
shiplog share explain manager --latest
```

## Read vs write

Read-only commands:

- `shiplog doctor --setup`
- `shiplog sources status`
- `shiplog doctor --setup --json`
- `shiplog status --latest`
- `shiplog status --latest --json`
- `shiplog repair plan --latest`
- `shiplog repair diff --latest`
- `shiplog runs diff --latest`
- `shiplog share explain manager --latest`

Write-producing commands:

- `shiplog init --guided`
- `shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain`
- `shiplog journal add --from-repair <repair_id>`
- explicit `shiplog share manager|public` rendering commands

`doctor`, `status`, and `share explain` do not render profile artifacts. Use
explicit share commands only after share explanation or verification says the
profile is ready.

## Agent-readable surfaces

- `shiplog doctor --setup --json` exposes setup readiness without provider
  probing, writes, or secret values.
- `shiplog status --latest --json` exposes the review-loop state, blockers,
  next actions, write posture, and receipt references without scraping terminal
  prose.
- `shiplog report export-agent-pack --latest` exports report receipts for
  support and automation workflows.

Agents should consume JSON receipts, not `packet.md` or terminal prose.

## What shiplog does not do

- Does not write performance-review prose.
- Does not score employees.
- Does not mutate provider records.
- Does not query providers from `doctor` or `status`.
- Does not render manager/public packets from `status` or `share explain`.
- Does not enable optional LLM clustering unless built with `--features llm`
  and configured explicitly.
