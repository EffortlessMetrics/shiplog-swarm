and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Testing Infrastructure

- Added ~4,000+ new tests across 200+ crates (from ~1,200 to ~5,600+)
- Added comprehensive property tests (proptest) for data integrity
- Added snapshot tests (insta) for serialization stability
- Added BDD scenarios for workflow testing
- Added cross-crate integration tests for full pipeline validation
- Added E2E CLI tests
- Added 34 fuzz targets with seed corpora
- Added doc-tests for core API crates

### CI/CD Improvements

- Added dependabot.yml for automated dependency updates
- Fixed CI toolchain consistency (standardized on Rust 1.92)
- Updated mutation testing configuration with proper tier assignments
- Updated property testing workflow to cover all crates

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- CLI `manual` source wiring for `collect`, `refresh`, and `run`, enabling YAML manual-event ingestion through `shiplog-ingest-manual`
- GitHub CLI cache controls: `--cache-dir <PATH>` and `--no-cache`

### Changed

- GitHub ingestion now enables persistent API caching by default at `<out>/.cache` unless `--no-cache` is used
- `collect json` now honors `--regen` for suggested workstream regeneration, matching other collect sources
- `GithubIngestor::with_cache` now creates missing cache directories automatically

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **LLM-assisted workstream clustering** (`shiplog-cluster-llm`): optional OpenAI-compatible endpoint for semantic workstream grouping, with automatic fallback to repo-based clustering on failure
- **`import` subcommand**: re-render a pre-built ledger directory from an upstream system or previous shiplog run
- **Redaction alias cache persistence**: `redaction.aliases.json` provides stable alias mappings across runs
- **`--zip` flag**: write a zip archive next to the run folder (available on `collect`, `render`, `refresh`, `import`, `run`)
- **`--run-dir` flag**: explicit run directory for `refresh` (overrides auto-detection)
- **`SourceSystem::Other(String)` variant**: extension point for third-party source systems (`#[non_exhaustive]`)
- **Bundle exclusion of `redaction.aliases.json`**: alias cache is excluded from bundle manifests and zip archives to prevent redaction bypass
- **LLM feature gate**: `shiplog-cluster-llm` is now an optional dependency behind the `llm` feature (default on); build with `--no-default-features` to omit it
- Module-level documentation (`//!` doc blocks) for `shiplog-schema`, `shiplog-coverage`, `shiplog-workstreams`, `shiplog-engine`, and `shiplog-ports`
- CLI Reference section in README.md with full flag table
- LLM clustering flags (`--llm-cluster`, `--llm-api-endpoint`, `--llm-model`, `--llm-api-key`) documented across all 4 doc files
- Missing sections in GEMINI.md and copilot-instructions.md to sync with CLAUDE.md

### Changed

- Crate-specific descriptions for all 15 publishable crates (replacing generic workspace description)
- Added `keywords` and `categories` to all publishable crate Cargo.toml files
- Marked `shiplog-testkit` as `publish = false`
- `CACHE_FILENAME` in `shiplog-redact` is now `pub` for cross-crate documentation

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- Refactored MarkdownRenderer for improved readability and consistency
- Enhanced documentation in CLAUDE.md with error handling, runtime, and output directory details
- Added package metadata (description, repository) for crates.io publishing
- Fixed internal crate dependencies to specify version requirements for publishing

  - Coverage manifest validation

- **Manual Events** (`shiplog-ingest-manual`):
  - Track non-GitHub work (incidents, design docs, mentoring, launches, migrations)
  - YAML-based manual event definitions
  - Event type classification with emoji support

- **Local SQLite Cache** (`shiplog-cache`):
  - Durable caching for GitHub API responses
  - TTL-based expiration (default 24 hours)
