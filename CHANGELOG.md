## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added CLI-supported GitLab, Jira, and Linear sources across `collect`, `refresh`, and legacy `run`.
- Added local git parity for `refresh git` and `run git`.
- Added `shiplog merge` to combine existing source runs into one packet.
- Added `shiplog collect multi` to collect enabled `shiplog.toml` sources into one merged packet while recording partial source failures in coverage warnings.
- Added first-run commands and defaults: `shiplog init`, `shiplog doctor`, `shiplog config validate`, `shiplog config explain`, `shiplog config migrate`, relative date presets, latest-run aliases, and GitHub/GitLab `--me` identity inference.
- Added run discovery and artifact opening with `shiplog runs list/show` and `shiplog open packet/workstreams/out`.
- Added workstream curation commands for list, validate, create, rename, move, split, receipt selection, and delete.
- Added packet coverage and limits summaries, source/gap summaries, evidence anchors, claim prompts, render modes (`packet`, `scaffold`, `receipts`), receipt limits, and appendix density controls.
- Added cache visibility and cleanup with `shiplog cache stats`, `shiplog cache inspect`, and `shiplog cache clean`.
- Added example configs and a review-cycle guide with fixture-safe docs command tests.

### Changed

- Promoted GitLab, Jira, Linear, team, and merge surfaces into the v0.3.0 publish set instead of leaving production-looking crates unpublished.
- Aligned the workspace package surface around publishable public crates plus dev-only tooling.
- Versioned `shiplog.toml` with `[shiplog] config_version = 1` while keeping legacy configs as implicit v1.
- Expanded release smoke tests to exercise product command help on the downloaded release artifact and release build.

### Security

- Manager and public render/bundle profiles now fail closed unless `--redact-key` or the configured redaction-key environment variable is provided.

### Testing and Release Proof

- Added package boundary and package version audits to prevent unpublished production crates and mixed release versions.
- Added fixture-safe command coverage for the review-cycle documentation path.
- Kept mutation testing advisory while the baseline matures.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- CLI `manual` source wiring for `collect`, `refresh`, and `run`, enabling YAML manual-event ingestion through `shiplog-ingest-manual`
- GitHub CLI cache controls: `--cache-dir <PATH>` and `--no-cache`

### Changed

- GitHub ingestion now enables persistent API caching by default at `<out>/.cache` unless `--no-cache` is used
- `collect json` now honors `--regen` for suggested workstream regeneration, matching other collect sources
- `GithubIngestor::with_cache` now creates missing cache directories automatically

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **LLM-assisted workstream clustering** (`shiplog-cluster-llm`): optional OpenAI-compatible endpoint for semantic workstream grouping, with automatic fallback to repo-based clustering on failure
- **`import` subcommand**: re-render a pre-built ledger directory from an upstream system or previous shiplog run
- **Redaction alias cache persistence**: `redaction.aliases.json` provides stable alias mappings across runs
- **`--zip` flag**: write a zip archive next to the run folder (available on `collect`, `render`, `refresh`, `import`, `run`)
- **`--run-dir` flag**: explicit run directory for `refresh` (overrides auto-detection)
- **`SourceSystem::Other(String)` variant**: extension point for third-party source systems (`#[non_exhaustive]`)
- **Bundle exclusion of `redaction.aliases.json`**: alias cache is excluded from bundle manifests and zip archives to prevent redaction bypass
- **LLM feature gate**: `shiplog-cluster-llm` is now an optional dependency behind the `llm` feature, off by default; build with `--features llm` to include it
- Module-level documentation (`//!` doc blocks) for `shiplog-schema`, `shiplog-coverage`, `shiplog-workstreams`, `shiplog-engine`, and `shiplog-ports`
- CLI Reference section in README.md with full flag table
- LLM clustering flags (`--llm-cluster`, `--llm-api-endpoint`, `--llm-model`, `--llm-api-key`) documented across all 4 doc files
- Missing sections in GEMINI.md and copilot-instructions.md to sync with CLAUDE.md

### Changed

- Crate-specific descriptions for all 15 publishable crates (replacing generic workspace description)
- Added `keywords` and `categories` to all publishable crate Cargo.toml files
- Marked `shiplog-testkit` as `publish = false`
- `CACHE_FILENAME` in `shiplog-redact` is now `pub` for cross-crate documentation

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- Refactored MarkdownRenderer for improved readability and consistency
- Enhanced documentation in CLAUDE.md with error handling, runtime, and output directory details
- Added package metadata (description, repository) for crates.io publishing
