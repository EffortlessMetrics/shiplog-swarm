# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build, Test, and Lint Commands

```bash
cargo build --workspace                  # Build all crates
cargo build -p <crate-name>             # Build a single crate (e.g., shiplog::engine)
cargo test --workspace                   # Run all tests
cargo test -p <crate-name>              # Test a single crate
cargo test -p <crate-name> <test_name>  # Run a specific test
cargo test -p <crate-name> <test_name> -- --exact --nocapture  # Exact match with output
cargo fmt --all -- --check               # Check formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings  # Lint
cargo mutants --workspace                # Mutation testing
```

Snapshot tests use `insta` (YAML format). Update snapshots when intentionally changing outputs:
- PowerShell: `$env:INSTA_UPDATE='auto'; cargo test -p <crate-name>`
- Unix: `INSTA_UPDATE=auto cargo test -p <crate-name>`

Run the CLI: `cargo run -p shiplog -- <subcommand>`. Preferred workflow: `collect` (fetch events) → edit `workstreams.suggested.yaml` into `workstreams.yaml` → `render` (regenerate packet). `refresh` re-fetches events while preserving curated workstreams. `import` re-renders a pre-built ledger directory. `run` is legacy (collect + render in one shot).

Key CLI flags:
- `--mode merged|created` (which PR lens to ingest)
- `--include-reviews` (include review events where available)
- `--no-details` (omit verbose details in packet)
- `--throttle-ms <N>` (rate-limit API calls)
- `--api-base <URL>` (GitHub Enterprise Server API base)
- `--cache-dir <PATH>` (override GitHub API cache directory; default `<out>/.cache`)
- `--no-cache` (disable GitHub API caching)
- `--regen` (regenerate `workstreams.suggested.yaml`; never overwrites `workstreams.yaml`)
- `--run-dir <PATH>` (explicit run directory for `refresh`, overrides auto-detection)
- `--zip` (write a zip archive next to the run folder)
- Redaction: `--redact-key` or `SHIPLOG_REDACT_KEY` controls generation of manager/public packets
- `--bundle-profile internal|manager|public` (scope zip/bundle to a redaction profile)
- `manual` source for non-GitHub YAML events: `collect|refresh|run manual --events <PATH> --since <DATE> --until <DATE> [--user <NAME>]`
- LLM clustering (feature-gated, default off; `collect`/`import`/`run`): `--llm-cluster`, `--llm-api-endpoint <URL>`, `--llm-model <NAME>`, `--llm-api-key <KEY>` (or `SHIPLOG_LLM_API_KEY`)

## Architecture

Module-first Rust workspace (edition 2024, MSRV 1.95) following **Clean Architecture / ports-and-adapters**. Public crates are deliberate external contracts; implementation seams should start as modules inside an owning crate. The 0.7 contraction lane is reducing earlier implementation crates into owner modules. The CLI (`apps/shiplog`) drives the product flow and currently composes remaining internal workspace support plus inlined ingest/render/cache/coverage modules. See `API_SURFACE.md` before adding or promoting package boundaries.

### Dependency layers (top → bottom)

```
apps/shiplog (CLI, clap)
  └─ shiplog::engine (orchestration)
       ├─ Ingest adapters: apps/shiplog/src/ingest/*
       ├─ shiplog-workstreams (clustering + user-curated YAML)
       ├─ shiplog-cluster-llm (optional LLM-assisted clustering, feature-gated)
       ├─ shiplog-redact (deterministic HMAC-SHA256 aliasing, 3 profiles)
       ├─ apps/shiplog/src/render + engine artifact writer
       └─ shiplog-bundle (zip + SHA256 checksums)
  Shared foundations:
       shiplog-ports (trait definitions: Ingestor, Renderer, Redactor, WorkstreamClusterer)
       shiplog-schema (canonical event model, EventKind, manifests)
       shiplog-ids (deterministic SHA256-based EventId, RunId, WorkstreamId)
       apps/shiplog/src/coverage (time windows, completeness tracking)
       apps/shiplog/src/cache (SQLite-backed API response cache, rusqlite bundled)
       shiplog-testkit (fixture builders for tests)
```

**Key rule:** Adapters depend on ports and schema, never the reverse.

### Core design principles

- **Receipts-first:** Every claim must trace to fetched evidence. Missing data is explicitly reported in `coverage.manifest.json`, never silently omitted.
- **User-owned workstreams:** `workstreams.yaml` is user-curated and never overwritten; auto-generated suggestions go to `workstreams.suggested.yaml`.
- **Deterministic redaction:** Three profiles (internal/manager/public). Same input + same key = same alias across runs via HMAC-SHA256.
- **Immutable event ledger:** `ledger.events.jsonl` is the canonical, append-only event log.
- **SourceSystem string serde:** `SourceSystem` serialises as flat lowercase strings (`"github"`, `"json_import"`, `"local_git"`, `"manual"`, `"unknown"`). Deserialization is case-insensitive for backward compatibility with old PascalCase values.

### Error handling

- `anyhow::Result<T>` with `.context("description")?` for error propagation throughout.
- Add contextual messages with `.with_context(|| format!(...))` for dynamic info.
- Do not introduce `thiserror` enums or bare `.unwrap()` where `anyhow` context is expected.

### Runtime

- GitHub ingest currently uses `reqwest::blocking`. If introducing async, isolate it inside adapters; don't leak it into core crates.

### Output directory structure

Outputs go under `out/<run_id>/`: `packet.md`, `ledger.events.jsonl`, `coverage.manifest.json`, `workstreams.yaml`, `profiles/{manager,public}/packet.md` (redacted), `bundle.manifest.json`.

### Testing conventions

- Unit tests live next to the crate or owner module they verify.
- Snapshot tests (`insta`, YAML format) in `shiplog::render` and `shiplog::engine` - review snapshot diffs carefully.
- Property-based tests (`proptest`) in `shiplog-redact` for redaction leak detection.
- Shared fixtures via `shiplog-testkit::fixtures` to avoid cross-crate duplication.
- BDD-style test infrastructure in `shiplog-testkit::bdd` for scenario-driven integration tests.
- Fuzz harnesses in `fuzz/` (not part of workspace; requires `cargo-fuzz`).

### Boundary convention

Prefix public packages with `shiplog-` only when a boundary has earned an external contract. New orthogonal responsibilities should become module folders first. Promote a module to a crate only when it is a stable contract, a trust surface, a real adapter boundary, or a heavy/risky optional boundary.

### Crate tiers

| Tier | Crates | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Stable contracts | `shiplog-ids`, `shiplog-schema`, `shiplog-ports` | No adapter deps |
| Trust surfaces | `shiplog-redact`, `shiplog-bundle`, `shiplog-workstreams`; inlined `shiplog::coverage`, `shiplog::cache`, `shiplog::render::*` | Depend on foundation |
| Adapters | `shiplog::ingest::*` | Depend on foundation and ports |
| Orchestration | `shiplog::engine` | Wires adapters via ports |
| App | `shiplog` (CLI) | Feature-gates: `llm` (default off) |
| Test-only | `shiplog-testkit` | `publish = false` |
| Owner modules | Internal SRP seams inside their owning crates | Not separate packages |

### Publishing

0.7 release tooling publishes only the supported public surface from `policy/publish-allowlist.toml` by default. Workspace membership is not publish eligibility. Dry-run the allowed surface through the package proof scripts rather than publishing every workspace member.
