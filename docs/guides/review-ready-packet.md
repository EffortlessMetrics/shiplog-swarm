# Review-ready packet guide

Use this after a first intake has produced a packet and you want to know whether
it is ready to support a self-review conversation. The goal is not to generate
performance-review prose. The goal is to turn repaired evidence into a
defensible scaffold: readiness, claim candidates, missing-context prompts, and
share posture.

The loop is:

```text
collect -> repair -> rerun -> compare -> interpret -> share
```

## Run the first packet

Start with intake and read the report before editing anything.

```bash
shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain
shiplog open intake-report --latest
shiplog open packet --latest
```

Read these sections first:

- `Packet readiness`: whether the packet is ready, caveated, repairable, or
  still missing evidence.
- `Source Freshness` and `Skipped Sources`: what was included or unavailable.
- `Repair items`: safe local actions derived from report receipts.
- `Evidence debt`: curation or context gaps that can weaken the packet.

If the packet has no evidence, do not treat that as failure. Treat it as the
first diagnostic run.

## Repair locally

Print the repair queue:

```bash
shiplog repair plan --latest
```

For a missing manual-evidence repair item, add a local journal event from the
report-derived repair ID:

```bash
shiplog journal add --from-repair <repair_id>
```

This writes `manual_events.yaml`. It does not mutate GitHub, Jira, Linear,
GitLab, or any provider record. Replace generated placeholder context with what
actually happened before relying on the packet.

## Rerun and compare

After the repair, rerun intake and compare both repair state and packet quality.

```bash
shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain
shiplog repair diff --latest
shiplog runs diff --latest
shiplog open packet --latest
```

Read `repair diff` first:

- `Cleared`: a repair key was present in the older report and absent in the
  newer report.
- `New`: a repair key appears only in the newer report.
- `Still open`: the same repair remains.
- `Changed`: the repair key remains but the action, reason, or clear condition
  changed.

Then read `runs diff`:

- `Improved`: evidence counts, manual evidence, readiness, claim candidates, or
  cleared repairs moved in a better direction.
- `Regressed`: evidence, gaps, readiness, claim candidates, or repair state got
  worse.
- `Still weak`: skipped sources, open repairs, manual-only evidence, missing
  candidates, or other caveats still need human judgment.

The useful outcome is not "no warnings." The useful outcome is knowing exactly
what improved and what still needs context.

## Interpret packet readiness

Open `packet.md` and start at `Packet Readiness`.

Common states:

- `Ready`: the packet has source-backed evidence and no open repair blockers.
- `Ready with caveats`: useful, but still has source gaps, manual-only evidence,
  evidence debt, or open caveats.
- `Needs repair`: fixable report-derived repair items remain.
- `Needs evidence`: there is not enough evidence to support claims yet.

Do not hide caveats. A caveated packet is often still useful if the packet says
what evidence supports it and what remains weak.

## Use claim candidates safely

Read `Claim Candidates` as scaffolding, not prose.

Each candidate should tell you:

- the claim title;
- evidence strength;
- supporting sources and receipts;
- caveats;
- missing-context prompts;
- safe share profiles.

Use candidates to decide what you can defend. Do not copy them as final review
paragraphs without adding your own specific context. Shiplog should not invent
impact, outcomes, or performance narratives.

When a candidate has `manual_only` evidence, answer the missing-context prompt:

```text
Which source-backed receipt could confirm this?
```

If there is no receipt, keep the claim narrow or leave it out.

## Explain share posture

Before rendering a manager or public profile, ask what the profile would include,
remove, and block.

```bash
shiplog share explain manager --latest
shiplog share explain public --latest
```

The command is read-only. It does not require `SHIPLOG_REDACT_KEY`, and it does
not write `profiles/<profile>/packet.md` or `share.manifest.json`. Use it to
answer:

- what the profile includes;
- what redaction removes;
- whether the missing redaction key blocks rendering;
- what still needs review before sharing.

When you are ready to write a share profile:

```bash
export SHIPLOG_REDACT_KEY=replace-with-a-stable-secret
shiplog share verify manager --latest
shiplog share manager --latest --zip
```

For public sharing, use the strict public verification path:

```bash
shiplog share verify public --latest --strict
shiplog share public --latest --zip
```

Strict verification is a guardrail, not a privacy guarantee. Review the rendered
public packet before it leaves your organization.

## Stop conditions

Stop and use the packet when:

- readiness is `Ready` or `Ready with caveats`;
- the caveats are visible and acceptable for your audience;
- claim candidates are backed by receipts or explicitly marked as manual-only;
- missing-context prompts have been answered in your own words;
- share posture says the target profile is not blocked.

Keep repairing when:

- readiness is `Needs evidence`;
- a repair item has a safe local action you can complete;
- a skipped source would materially change the claims;
- a claim candidate depends only on memory and has no supporting receipt.

The defensible path is: collect, repair, rerun, compare, prepare, share.
