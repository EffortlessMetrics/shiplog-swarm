# Risk Packs

A risk pack is a path-pattern → label / lane mapping. A PR that touches
matching paths auto-applies the listed labels and selects the listed
PR-targeted lanes.

The machine-readable mapping lives in
[`policy/ci-risk-packs.toml`](../../policy/ci-risk-packs.toml). This doc is
the human explanation: what each pack means, why it exists, and what it
costs.

## Why packs exist

Risk packs encode "if you change X, you probably want Y." Without packs:

- Reviewers manually apply labels every time, which they forget.
- Authors don't know which lanes are appropriate for a given change.
- High-risk surfaces (redaction, bundle integrity, schema/ids) end up
  defaulting to the same coverage as a docs change.

Packs make routing reproducible: the PR plan ([`ci-plan-json.md`](ci-plan-json.md))
shows which packs matched and which lanes were therefore selected.

## How packs combine

A PR can match multiple packs. The selected lanes are the union; the
applied labels are the union; the LEM forecast adds the unique lanes.

A PR that matches the `docs-only` pack and no other pack runs only the
PR plan + the always-on PR-fast lanes (which are still gated by the
`docs-only` skip-by-policy rule, see [`skipped-by-policy.md`](skipped-by-policy.md)).

## Why some packs are mutation-targeted and others are property-only

**Mutation-targeted** packs (`redaction-privacy`, `bundle-share`,
`schema-ids`, `source-adapter`, `policy-workflows` via `full-ci`) are
trust-surface changes. A regression here can ship invisible bad output;
mutation testing is the strongest available oracle-adequacy check.

**Property-only** packs (`report-schema`, `manual-journal`,
`period-window`) are schema / invariant surfaces. The strongest signal is
that invariants hold under randomized input; mutation is overkill for the
PR-level review.

**BDD** packs (`source-adapter`, `cli-product`) are user-flow surfaces.
The strongest signal is that the flows still work end-to-end.

**Release-package** routes through release preflight because its concern
is publishability, not behavior.

## What "selected lane" means

A selected lane is **opted-in for this PR**. It still has to be wired up
(the PR plan in PR #146 emits the selection; PR #155 wires the lane
routing in the actual workflows). Until those PRs land, risk-pack
selection is documented but not executed.

## Adding or changing a pack

A new risk pack:

1. Lands first in `policy/ci-risk-packs.toml` with a new `[[risk_pack]]` entry
   (per the schema in [`policy/README.md`](../../policy/README.md)).
2. Adds a row to the catalog table above.
3. Documents why the pack exists (what failure mode it addresses) and which
   lanes it selects.
4. Should not auto-apply `full-ci` unless the touched surface is genuinely
   cross-cutting; that label implies hard-tier spend.

A changed risk pack:

1. Updates the TOML.
2. Updates the catalog table.
3. Notes the change in the PR description so reviewers see the routing
   delta.
