# `ci-actuals.json` Contract

The CI actuals workflow (added in PR #148) writes a machine-readable
record of what each lane actually cost — wall-clock, runner, cache, and
conclusion — so the LEM forecast in
[`ci-plan-json.md`](ci-plan-json.md) can be calibrated against
observed reality.

The JSON Schema lives at
[`contracts/schemas/ci-actuals.v1.schema.json`](../../contracts/schemas/ci-actuals.v1.schema.json).
This doc is the human reference.

## Why actuals matter

Without actuals, LEM is a forecast: each lane has a `base_lem` in
`policy/ci-lanes.toml`, the PR plan sums them, and that's the projected
cost. But the projection is only as good as the base_lem estimates, which
are educated guesses pre-rollout.

Actuals close the loop:

- **Calibrate forecasts.** If `lane.bdd` consistently runs ~12 minutes
  but `base_lem = 32`, the estimate is wrong. The actuals receipt
  surfaces the drift.
- **Spot regressions.** A lane that suddenly takes 2× longer is a
  signal — toolchain change, dep upgrade, runner change, cache miss.
- **Hard-enforce budgets.** Hard enforcement of LEM budgets is a
  follow-up release decision after we have ≥1 month of actuals to
  confirm the model.

## Where it lives

- Output path: `target/ci/ci-actuals.json` (per workflow run, uploaded
  as artifact)
- Aggregate: a long-running collector (later; not in PR #148) merges
  per-run files into a rolling time series

## How `actuals` is collected

Per workflow run, an aggregator job runs after the workflow's other
jobs and:

1. Queries the GitHub Actions API for per-job timings on this run.
2. Joins each job to its `lane_id` via the `policy/ci-lanes.toml`
   `workflow` field.
3. Reads the cache hit/miss from each job's step output (the
   `Swatinem/rust-cache` action exposes this).
4. Reads `conclusion` and `skip_reason` from the job's step summary.
5. Writes `target/ci/ci-actuals.json` and uploads as an artifact.

Implementation detail of PR #148. The schema is stable; the collector
mechanism may evolve.

## What "drift" means

`drift_pct` is the gap between forecast and actuals. Interpretation:

- **−50% to +20%**: forecast is roughly right; no action.
- **+20% to +50%**: forecast underestimates. Update `base_lem` in
  `policy/ci-lanes.toml`. May indicate a new dep slowing the build.
- **> +50%**: significant overrun. Investigate the lane (cache miss?
  toolchain regression? new test?).
- **< −50%**: forecast overestimates. Update `base_lem`. Often happens
  when a lane gets faster (e.g. cache improvements, test selection).

A persistent drift pattern across PRs is actionable; a single-PR drift
is usually cache-warmth or runner variance.

## Stability

`schema_version = 1` will not change incompatibly. Adding optional fields
is allowed without bumping the version. The two most likely future
additions:

- `lanes[].external_cost_usd` — mirror of `policy/ci-budget.toml`
  `external_cost_notes`, computed for bot lanes
- `lanes[].steps[]` — per-step timings for fine-grained drift analysis

These would be added in v1; consumers must tolerate unknown fields.
