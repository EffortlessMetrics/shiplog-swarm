# CI Lane Map

The mechanical inventory of every CI workflow and job, what it claims, what
it costs, and how it is routed. This is the human-readable companion to
[`policy/ci-lanes.toml`](../../policy/ci-lanes.toml). When the two disagree,
the TOML is authoritative; this doc explains it.

Referential integrity of every `[lane.*]` entry is machine-checked by
`cargo xtask check-lane-mappings` (run in the `Policy gates` CI job): for
each lane that declares `workflow`/`workflow_name`/`job_name`, the
checker verifies the workflow file exists, its top-level `name:` matches,
and the declared job display name resolves to a real job in the file.
Workflow-catchall lanes (`workflow_name` set, `job_name` omitted) are
explicitly accepted.

It is added in PR #142 (Phase 1 — machine-readable roadmap) and is the
anti-duplication map: every workflow/job declares one **intent**, and any
duplicate intent declares `duplicate_of`. See
[`cost-and-verification-policy.md`](cost-and-verification-policy.md) for the
doctrine.

## Reading the table

| Column | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| Workflow | Path under `.github/workflows/` (or planned addition in a later PR) |
| Job | The job name inside the workflow (when the workflow has multiple) |
| Trigger | What causes the job to run today |
| Default PR? | Runs on every PR by default (yes/no) |
| Blocking | Failure blocks merge (yes/no/advisory) |
| Runner | GitHub-hosted runner the job uses |
| Base LEM | Estimated [Linux Equivalent Minutes](lem-budgeting.md) per run |
| Intent | The single primary thing the job claims |
| Failure mode caught | What real defect this job is designed to surface |
| Evidence | Artifact / step-summary / receipt the job produces |
| `duplicate_of` | Lane that produces the same intent (if any) |
| Target lane | Where this lane should live in the steady-state lane model |
| Owner | Who responds when the lane fails (workspace package or `release`/`policy`/`ci`/`docs`) |

`Base LEM` is the steady-state estimate. Actuals are recorded in
[`ci-actuals.md`](ci-actuals.md) once PR #148 lands.
