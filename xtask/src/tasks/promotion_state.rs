//! `cargo xtask promotion-state`
//!
//! The single bounded current-promotion manifest is
//! `plans/shiplog-swarm/promotion-state.toml`. It records only the latest
//! completed promotion slice and the pending swarm range; historical
//! promotions stay in `plans/shiplog-swarm/implementation-plan.md` and Git
//! history.
//!
//! This task validates that manifest (failing closed on malformed state) and
//! generates the human-readable `plans/shiplog-swarm/current-promotion.md`
//! from it. `--check` verifies the manifest and that the checked-in generated
//! Markdown matches what the manifest would produce. The same invariant is
//! enforced inside the required `cargo test` gate by the
//! `checked_in_current_promotion_md_matches_manifest` test, so a second source
//! of truth cannot silently drift back in.
