//! Transition receipts: bounded divergence authority for the swarm cutover.
//!
//! During the cutover, some changes landed directly on the source repository
//! instead of flowing through a swarm promotion. A transition receipt records
//! one such source PR and, per path, what the swarm side did about it. That
//! evidence is what lets `promote` accept a difference between the two trees
//! that `policy/source-only-paths.toml` does not permanently allow.
//!
//! Three properties keep this from becoming a standing bypass:
//!
//! * **Per-path disposition.** A source PR is rarely uniform. The port that
//!   landed as source #666 / swarm #274 left seven paths byte-identical and six
//!   intentionally different, so one status over one path list would have been
//!   false for half of it.
//! * **Bounded lifetime.** An entry grants nothing once `consumed_by` names the
//!   promotion that reconciled it. Entries are kept as history, not authority.
//! * **Narrow authority.** Only a resolved receipt (`equivalent`,
//!   `dependency_equivalent`, `tree_equivalent`, `superseded_in_swarm`) grants anything, and only
//!   permission for the overlay
//!   to keep swarm content on a path both sides changed, because swarm
//!   demonstrably already carries or supersedes the source change.
//!   `missing_in_swarm` grants nothing and blocks: swarm does not carry the
//!   change, so promoting would revert it. `conflicting` blocks outright.
//!   An exceptional `resolution = "discard_source"` may explicitly choose the
//!   swarm tree for a missing-in-swarm path, but only with exact tree entries,
//!   a decision receipt, and a reason; it is bounded by `consumed_by`.
//!
//! Evidence is checked rather than assumed: the recorded merge SHAs must belong
//! to merged PRs and be reachable from the relevant branch, `equivalent` must
//! agree under `git patch-id --stable` for that path, `dependency_equivalent`
//! must agree on the exact Cargo.lock package-version transitions,
//! `tree_equivalent` must resolve to the same blob at that path on both promoted refs, and
//! `superseded_in_swarm` must present a contiguous version chain starting where
//! the source change started.
//!
//! `equivalent` and `tree_equivalent` are separate dispositions on purpose.
//! Patch identity is the stronger claim and stays exactly as strict as it was;
//! `tree_equivalent` exists for the real case where two repositories started
//! from different content and converged on identical content by different
//! patches, which patch identity cannot express and must not be made to.
