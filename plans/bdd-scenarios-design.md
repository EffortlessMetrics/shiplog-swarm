# BDD Scenario Design for shiplog ROADMAP Features

This document provides comprehensive BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) scenario designs for all features in the shiplog ROADMAP. Each scenario follows the Given/When/Then pattern and is designed to be implemented using the existing BDD framework from [`shiplog-testkit`](../crates/shiplog-testkit/src/bdd.rs).

## Framework Overview

The BDD framework in [`shiplog-testkit`](../crates/shiplog-testkit/src/bdd.rs) provides:

- **`ScenarioContext`**: Carries state through Given/When/Then steps with typed storage (strings, numbers, flags, paths, data)
- **`Scenario`**: Builder pattern for composing scenarios with descriptive steps
- **Assertion helpers**: `assert_present`, `assert_eq`, `assert_true`, `assert_false`, `assert_contains`, `assert_not_contains`
- **Fixture builders**: `EventBuilder`, `CoverageBuilder`, `WorkstreamsBuilder`

### Scenario Structure Template

```rust
let scenario = Scenario::new("Descriptive scenario name")
    .given("precondition 1", |ctx| { /* setup */ })
    .given("precondition 2", |ctx| { /* setup */ })
    .when("user action", |ctx| {
        // Execute action
        Ok(())
    })
    .then("expected outcome 1", |ctx| {
        // Verify outcome
        Ok(())
    })
    .then("expected outcome 2", |ctx| {
        // Verify outcome
        Ok(())
    });
```

### Scenario Naming Convention

Use descriptive, user-centric names:

- ✅ "User downloads and installs binary for their platform"
- ✅ "User ingests commits from local git repository"
- ❌ "Binary download works"
- ❌ "Git ingest function"

### Step Description Guidelines

**Given steps** should describe preconditions:
- ✅ "a user with GitHub token configured"
- ✅ "a date range for the past quarter"
- ❌ "setup user"
- ❌ "configure dates"

**When steps** should describe user actions:
- ✅ "they collect events from GitHub"
- ✅ "they render the packet"
- ❌ "collect events"
- ❌ "render"

**Then steps** should describe expected outcomes:
- ✅ "events should be collected"
- ✅ "the packet should exist"
- ❌ "events collected"
- ❌ "packet exists"

### Context Key Naming

Use consistent, descriptive keys:

| Key Type | Pattern | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Strings | `snake_case` | `username`, `repo`, `since` |
| Numbers | `snake_case` | `event_count`, `pr_count`, `cache_total` |
| Flags | `snake_case` | `events_collected`, `cache_hit`, `command_failed` |
| Paths | `snake_case` | `repo_path`, `config_path`, `packet_path` |

### Assertion Usage

Prefer specific assertions over generic ones:

```rust
// Good
assert_eq(count, 25, "event count")?
assert_true(ctx.flag("cache_hit").unwrap_or(false), "cache hit")?

// Avoid
assert_true(true, "something happened")?
```

### Test Data Management

Use fixture builders for consistent test data:

```rust
use crate::bdd::builders::*;

let event = EventBuilder::new("owner/repo", 42, "Fix bug")
    .kind(EventKind::PullRequest)
    .build();

let coverage = CoverageBuilder::new("alice")
    .dates(since, until)
    .completeness(Completeness::Complete)
    .build();
```

### Mock External Dependencies

For scenarios involving external APIs (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, LLM), use mock backends:

```rust
use shiplog_cluster_llm::MockLlmBackend;

let mock_backend = MockLlmBackend::new();
mock_backend.set_response("workstream: [1,2,3]");
let clusterer = LlmClusterer::new(Box::new(mock_backend), config);
```

### Performance Test Guidelines

For performance scenarios:

1. Set reasonable thresholds based on expected usage
2. Measure both time and memory
3. Use consistent test data sizes
4. Document the hardware/environment assumptions

Example thresholds:
- Binary startup: < 100ms
- Cache stats: < 1 second
- Render 500 receipts: < 5 seconds
- Collect 2,000 MRs: < 60 seconds
- Cluster 1,000 events: < 60 seconds

## Summary

This design document provides comprehensive BDD scenarios for all shiplog ROADMAP features across three horizons:

- **v0.2.x (Now)**: 4 features, 36 scenarios
- **v0.3.x (Next)**: 5 features, 39 scenarios
- **Later (Exploratory)**: 5 features, 33 scenarios

**Total: 108 scenarios** covering:
- Primary user workflows
- Edge cases and error handling
- Integration between features
- Performance and load testing

Each scenario is designed to be:
- **User-centric**: Describes behavior from the user's perspective
- **Clear**: Uses descriptive Given/When/Then steps
- **Reusable**: Steps can be composed across scenarios
- **Testable**: Can be implemented using the existing BDD framework

The reusable step library provides a foundation for efficient test implementation, and the implementation guidelines ensure consistency across the test suite.
