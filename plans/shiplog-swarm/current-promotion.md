## Truth hierarchy

1. Git refs and ancestry
2. GitHub PR / check state
3. `plans/shiplog-swarm/promotion-state.toml` (this promotion's source of truth)
4. Generated reports (`target/source-of-truth/*`, this file)
5. Historical archive (`plans/shiplog-swarm/implementation-plan.md`)

## Topology boundary

- Product development remains authoritative in `EffortlessMetrics/shiplog-swarm`.
- Source promotion uses a regular merge commit; do not squash.
- Release authority, tags, publishing, signing, and release workflows remain in `EffortlessMetrics/shiplog`.

## Next action

Prepare the next source promotion for the pending swarm range with `cargo xtask promote --swarm-sha $(git rev-parse swarm/main)`. Carry these receipts in the next substantive swarm PR; do not open a receipt-only refresh PR.
