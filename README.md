> Compile your GitHub activity into defensible self-review packets -- with receipts.

## Why shiplog?

Performance reviews ask "what did you ship?" shiplog answers that question with evidence.

**Receipts-first.** Every claim in a shiplog packet traces back to fetched data -- merged PRs, reviews, manual entries. Missing data is explicitly flagged in a coverage manifest, never silently omitted.

**Coverage-first.** shiplog tracks what it queried and what might be incomplete. The coverage manifest documents API query windows, pagination limits hit, and gaps -- so you know exactly what the packet does and does not cover.

**Safe sharing.** Three deterministic redaction profiles (internal, manager, public) let you share packets at the right level of detail. Same key + same input = same aliases across runs, powered by HMAC-SHA256.

shiplog is not an analytics dashboard. It is not AI-generated narrative. It produces evidence you curate and a packet you can defend.

## Who is this for?

- **Individual contributors** preparing self-reviews, promo packets, or brag documents with concrete shipping receipts.
- **Tech leads** compiling structured proof of what their team shipped during a review cycle.
- **Anyone** who wants a repeatable, auditable record of their GitHub activity over a time window.

## Features

- 🔍 **Multi-source ingestion** — GitHub API, canonical JSONL, and manual YAML events
- 📊 **Automatic workstream clustering** — repo-based by default, optional LLM-assisted semantic grouping
- 🔒 **Deterministic HMAC-SHA256 redaction** — three profiles (internal / manager / public) with stable aliases
- ✅ **Coverage-first design** — every claim backed by receipts; gaps explicitly flagged in the coverage manifest
- 📦 **Zip bundling with checksums** — SHA256 manifest for integrity verification
- 🏗️ **Module-first clean architecture** — public crates for contracts, trust surfaces, adapters, and optional dependency boundaries

## Installation

### From crates.io (recommended)

```bash
cargo install shiplog
```

With optional LLM-assisted workstream clustering:

```bash
cargo install shiplog --features llm
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/shiplog.git
cd shiplog
cargo install --path apps/shiplog
```

Developers working on shiplog itself can run directly:

```bash
cargo run -p shiplog -- <subcommand>
```

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.92+
- A `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub ingestion

## Quick start

shiplog follows a **collect → curate → render** workflow. You fetch raw events once, organize them into workstreams, then re-render as many times as you like without hitting the API again.

### 1. Collect events from GitHub

```bash
shiplog collect github \
  --user your-username \
  --since 2025-07-01 \
  --until 2026-01-01 \
  --mode merged \
  --out ./out
```

This fetches merged PRs (and optionally reviews with `--include-reviews`) for the given user and time window. Results go into `out/<run_id>/` with a JSONL event ledger, coverage manifest, and an initial packet.

### 2. Curate workstreams

shiplog generates `workstreams.suggested.yaml` with auto-grouped workstreams based on repository. Copy it to `workstreams.yaml` and edit:

```bash
cp out/<run_id>/workstreams.suggested.yaml out/<run_id>/workstreams.yaml
# Edit workstreams.yaml: rename groups, move PRs between workstreams, add narrative.
```

`workstreams.yaml` is yours. shiplog never overwrites it.

### 3. Re-render the packet

```bash
shiplog render --run <run_id>
```

This regenerates `packet.md` using your curated workstreams while preserving the original ledger and coverage data. Add `--redact-key <KEY>` to also generate manager and public profile packets.

## Output layout

```text
out/<run_id>/
  packet.md                       # Main self-review packet (internal profile)
  workstreams.yaml                # User-curated workstream definitions
  workstreams.suggested.yaml      # Auto-generated workstream suggestions
  ledger.events.jsonl             # Canonical, append-only event log
  coverage.manifest.json          # What was queried, completeness, gaps
  bundle.manifest.json            # File checksums for integrity verification
  profiles/
    manager/packet.md             # Redacted: keeps context, strips sensitive details
    public/packet.md              # Redacted: aliases repos/workstreams, strips fields
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `collect <source>` | Fetch events from a source and generate packet artifacts |
| `render` | Re-render packet from existing ledger and workstreams |
| `refresh <source>` | Re-fetch events while preserving curated `workstreams.yaml` |
| `import` | Import an existing run directory and re-render |
| `run <source>` | Legacy: collect + render in one shot |

### Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `github` | PR and review ingestion from GitHub API (with adaptive slicing and SQLite cache) |
| `json` | Import from canonical JSONL event files |
| `manual` | Ingest non-GitHub work from a YAML events file |

### Examples

```bash
# Refresh receipts while keeping curated workstreams
shiplog refresh github \
  --user your-username \
  --since 2025-07-01 \
  --until 2026-01-01 \
  --run-dir out/20260115_143022 \
  --out ./out

# Import from pre-built JSON artifacts
shiplog collect json \
  --events ./ledger.events.jsonl \
  --coverage ./coverage.manifest.json \
  --out ./out

# Collect manual (non-GitHub) events
shiplog collect manual \
  --events ./manual_events.yaml \
  --user your-username \
  --since 2025-07-01 \
  --until 2026-01-01 \
  --out ./out
```

## Redaction and profiles

Generate redacted packets by providing a key:

```bash
shiplog render --run <run_id> --redact-key my-stable-secret
```

The key drives deterministic HMAC-SHA256 aliasing. Same key + same input = same aliases across runs.

| Field | Internal | Manager | Public |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| PR titles | Visible | Visible | Stripped |
| Repository names | Visible | Visible | Aliased (e.g., `repo-a7f3`) |
| URLs | Visible | Visible | Stripped |
| Workstream names | Visible | Visible | Aliased |
| Descriptions/details | Visible | Stripped | Stripped |
| Event counts and dates | Visible | Visible | Visible |

Bundle a specific profile as a zip:

```bash
shiplog render --run <run_id> --redact-key my-stable-secret --zip --bundle-profile manager
```

## Architecture

shiplog is a module-first Rust workspace following clean architecture (ports and adapters).
Public crates represent contracts, trust surfaces, real adapters, and optional dependency
boundaries; internal implementation seams live under their owning crates. See
[API_SURFACE.md](API_SURFACE.md) for the package boundary doctrine.

### Data flow

```text
GitHub API ─→ Ingestor ─→ Normalizer ─→ Clusterer ─→ Renderer ─→ Output
    │              │            │             │            │
    └── Cache      └── Schema   └── Workstreams └── Redact  └── Bundle
```

Events flow left-to-right through well-defined ports. Product boundaries are tested at the
crate level; smaller implementation seams stay as owner modules unless they earn an
external contract. Adapters depend on ports and schema, never the reverse.

The workspace may contain temporary internal implementation carriers during migration.
Those are not promoted public APIs; new boundaries should start as modules first.

## LLM clustering

By default, shiplog clusters events by repository. With the `llm` feature, you can enable semantic clustering via an OpenAI-compatible API:

```bash
# Install with LLM support
cargo install shiplog --features llm

# Use LLM clustering during collection
shiplog collect github \
  --user your-username \
  --since 2025-07-01 \
  --until 2026-01-01 \
  --out ./out \
  --llm-cluster \
  --llm-api-key $SHIPLOG_LLM_API_KEY
```

LLM clustering is feature-gated and off by default. It falls back to repository-based clustering on failure. See `--llm-api-endpoint` and `--llm-model` for endpoint configuration.
