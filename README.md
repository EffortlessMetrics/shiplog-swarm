> Compile your GitHub activity into defensible self-review packets -- with receipts.

## Why shiplog?

Performance reviews ask "what did you ship?" shiplog answers that question with evidence.

**Receipts-first.** Every claim in a shiplog packet traces back to fetched data -- merged PRs, reviews, manual entries. Missing data is explicitly flagged in a coverage manifest, never silently omitted.

**Coverage-first.** shiplog tracks what it queried and what might be incomplete. The coverage manifest documents API query windows, pagination limits hit, and gaps -- so you know exactly what the packet does and does not cover.

**Safe sharing.** Three deterministic redaction profiles (internal, manager, public) let you share packets at the right level of detail. Same key + same input = same aliases across runs, powered by keyed SHA-256.

shiplog is not an analytics dashboard. It is not AI-generated narrative. It produces evidence you curate, evidence anchors you can cite, and claim prompts you answer in your own voice.

## Who is this for?

- **Individual contributors** preparing self-reviews, promo packets, or brag documents with concrete shipping receipts.
- **Tech leads** compiling structured proof of what their team shipped during a review cycle.
- **Anyone** who wants a repeatable, auditable record of their GitHub activity over a time window.

## Features

- 🔍 **Multi-source ingestion** — GitHub API, GitLab API, Jira API, Linear API, local git commits, canonical JSONL, and manual YAML events
- 📊 **Automatic workstream clustering** — repo-based by default, optional LLM-assisted semantic grouping
- ✍️ **Human-authored review scaffolds** — per-workstream evidence anchors and claim prompts without generated narrative
- 🔒 **Deterministic keyed SHA-256 redaction** — three profiles (internal / manager / public) with stable aliases
- ✅ **Coverage-first design** — every claim backed by receipts; gaps explicitly flagged in the coverage manifest
- 📦 **Zip bundling with checksums** — SHA256 manifest for integrity verification
- 🏗️ **Module-first clean architecture** — public crates for contracts, trust surfaces, adapters, and optional dependency boundaries

## Installation

### From crates.io (recommended)

```bash
cargo install shiplog
```

With optional LLM-assisted workstream clustering:

```bash
cargo install shiplog --features llm
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/shiplog.git
cd shiplog
cargo install --path apps/shiplog
```

Developers working on shiplog itself can run directly:

```bash
cargo run -p shiplog -- <subcommand>
```

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.92+
- A `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub ingestion
- A `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitLab ingestion
- A `JIRA_TOKEN` environment variable for Jira ingestion
- A `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable for Linear ingestion

## Quick start

If the review form is already open, start here:

```bash
cargo install shiplog
shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain
shiplog open intake-report --latest
shiplog open packet --latest
```

`shiplog intake` is the best-effort rescue path: it creates starter local files
when needed, collects usable configured sources, records skipped sources,
renders a packet, runs review inspection, and prints next commands. The
underlying workflow is still **collect → curate → render** when you want more
control.

For a practical review-cycle walkthrough, see
[docs/guides/review-cycle.md](docs/guides/review-cycle.md). For the complete
`shiplog.toml` field reference, see
[docs/config-reference.md](docs/config-reference.md).

### 0. Fast review intake

```bash
shiplog intake --last-6-months --explain
shiplog open intake-report --latest
shiplog open packet --latest
```

Use this when you need a packet now. It uses `shiplog.toml` if present, creates
a minimal starter config if missing, skips unusable sources without hiding them,
and writes the packet, ledger, coverage manifest, workstream file, and bundle
manifest as soon as at least one source succeeds. It also writes
`intake.report.md` and `intake.report.json` as a durable checklist you can
reopen after the terminal scrolls away. It ends with a readiness summary: what
worked, what needs attention, and the next commands to run.
`--explain` prints source decisions and setup repair hints. Add
`--source github --source jira` to limit the intake, or `--no-open` to print
paths only. When sources are skipped, intake groups repair commands by source
and writes the same rerun guidance to `intake.report.md`. Re-running intake
creates a new run and reuses the latest prior `workstreams.yaml` when one
exists, without overwriting that earlier curation or `manual_events.yaml`.

### 1. Initialize local files

```bash
shiplog init
shiplog config validate
shiplog config explain
shiplog doctor
```

This writes `shiplog.toml` and `manual_events.yaml` in the current directory.
Use `shiplog init --source github --source jira` to scaffold a narrower source
set, `--dry-run` to preview, and `--force` to overwrite existing scaffold files.
Use `shiplog config validate` for a token-free config and local path check,
and `shiplog config explain` to see resolved defaults and enabled source
settings. New configs include `[shiplog] config_version = 1`; run
`shiplog config migrate` on older configs to add that metadata without changing
source settings. The full config reference is in
[docs/config-reference.md](docs/config-reference.md). Copy-adaptable configs
live in `examples/configs/`, including a fixture-safe local config that can be
checked with:

```bash
shiplog config validate --config examples/configs/local-git-json-manual.toml
shiplog config explain --config examples/configs/local-git-json-manual.toml
```

`shiplog doctor` adds token, output, identity, and safety checks before a
collection run.

### 2. Collect events from GitHub

For the fastest review-cycle path, collect all enabled sources from
`shiplog.toml` into one merged run:

```bash
shiplog collect multi --last-6-months
shiplog review --latest
shiplog review fixups --latest
shiplog runs list
shiplog open packet --latest
```

This reads the enabled `[sources.*]` sections from `shiplog.toml`, collects
each source, merges the resulting ledgers, and writes one packet, ledger,
coverage manifest, workstream file, and bundle manifest under `out/<run_id>/`.
Explicit date flags override the config window; otherwise `defaults.window`
is used. If one configured source fails but another source succeeds, shiplog
still writes the merged packet and records the skipped source in coverage
warnings.

For repeat review cycles, compare a prior run with the latest one:

```bash
shiplog runs compare --from review-2025-h2 --to latest
```

For weekly upkeep, use `shiplog review weekly` after a refresh or collection
run. It is read-only and highlights the latest evidence counts, source gaps,
evidence debt, and next commands before you render a packet.
Use `shiplog review fixups --latest` when you want only the highest-value
curation actions as runnable commands.
Add `--commands-only` when you want just the command lines for copy/paste.

For a single-source run, call the source directly:

```bash
shiplog collect github \
  --me \
  --last-6-months \
  --mode merged \
  --out ./out
```

This fetches merged PRs (and optionally reviews with `--include-reviews`) for the authenticated GitHub user and time window. If you omit a date window, shiplog defaults to the last six months. Use `--user <login>` instead of `--me` when you want an explicit identity. Results go into `out/<run_id>/` with a JSONL event ledger, coverage manifest, and an initial packet.

### 2. Curate workstreams

shiplog generates `workstreams.suggested.yaml` with auto-grouped workstreams based on repository. Use the workstream commands for safe edits:

```bash
shiplog workstreams list --run latest
shiplog review --latest
shiplog review fixups --latest
shiplog workstreams create --run latest --title "Platform Reliability"
shiplog workstreams rename --run latest --from "acme/platform" --to "Platform Reliability"
shiplog workstreams move --run latest --event <event_id> --to "Platform Reliability"
shiplog workstreams split --run latest --from "Platform Reliability" --to "Auth Migration" --matching "auth|oauth|sso" --create
shiplog workstreams receipts --run latest --workstream "Platform Reliability"
shiplog workstreams receipt add --run latest --workstream "Platform Reliability" --event <event_id>
shiplog workstreams receipt remove --run latest --workstream "Platform Reliability" --event <event_id>
shiplog workstreams delete --run latest --workstream "old bucket" --move-to "Platform Reliability"
shiplog workstreams validate --run latest
```

Use `journal add` when important work is not already visible in a source
adapter:

```bash
shiplog journal add \
  --date 2026-05-08 \
  --title "Debugged customer import incident" \
  --workstream "Customer Reliability" \
  --impact "Prevented repeat failure before the next import window" \
  --receipt ticket=https://example.invalid/ticket/OPS-123
shiplog journal list
shiplog journal edit --id manual-2026-05-08-debugged-customer-import-incident \
  --impact "Identified the bad upstream export shape before the next import window"
```

`shiplog review` suggests a copy-paste `journal add` command when a broad
workstream has implementation receipts but no manual outcome note.
`journal edit` replaces only the fields you pass; repeated `--tag` or
`--receipt` values replace those lists for the selected entry.
`shiplog review fixups` narrows the output to the top read-only curation
actions: add context, inspect receipt anchors, split broad buckets, validate
workstreams, or repair skipped sources. Use `--commands-only` for a terse
copy-friendly list.

If you prefer direct YAML editing, copy `workstreams.suggested.yaml` to
`workstreams.yaml` and edit that file.

`workstreams.yaml` is yours. shiplog never overwrites it.

### 3. Re-render the packet

```bash
shiplog render --latest
shiplog render --latest --receipt-limit 3 --appendix summary
shiplog render --latest --mode scaffold
shiplog render --latest --mode receipts
shiplog share manager --latest
shiplog open packet --latest
```

This regenerates `packet.md` using your curated workstreams while preserving
the original ledger and coverage data. Add `--redact-key <KEY>` to also
generate manager and public profile packets. On remote shells, add
`--print-path` to print the artifact path without launching an editor. Use
`--mode packet` for the default review packet, `--mode scaffold` for prompts
and evidence anchors, or `--mode receipts` for a dense audit view.
`--receipt-limit <N>` caps curated receipts shown in the main receipts section;
`--receipt-limit 0` shows none there and leaves the detail to the appendix
setting. Packet mode defaults depend on the selected profile: internal packets
keep a summary appendix, manager packets keep a summary appendix with fewer main
receipts, and public packets default to the lowest-density packet with appendix
omitted. Receipts mode defaults to a full audit appendix. Use
`--receipt-limit` and `--appendix full|summary|none` to override the density.
The default CLI packet opens with `Coverage and Limits`, listing completed
sources with event counts, skipped configured sources, and known gaps before the
summary, workstreams, receipts, and detailed coverage metadata.

For shareable outputs, `shiplog share manager --latest` and
`shiplog share public --latest` are convenience wrappers over the same
fail-closed redaction and bundle-profile behavior as `render`. They require
`--redact-key` or `SHIPLOG_REDACT_KEY`. Use
`shiplog share verify manager --latest` or
`shiplog share verify public --latest` to check the selected run, coverage
warnings, skipped sources, and redaction-key readiness without writing share
artifacts.

## Output layout

```text
out/<run_id>/
  packet.md                       # Main self-review packet (internal profile)
  workstreams.yaml                # User-curated workstream definitions
  workstreams.suggested.yaml      # Auto-generated workstream suggestions
  ledger.events.jsonl             # Canonical, append-only event log
  coverage.manifest.json          # What was queried, completeness, gaps
  bundle.manifest.json            # File checksums for integrity verification
  intake.report.md                # Review rescue checklist and next actions
  intake.report.json              # Structured intake report for tooling
  profiles/                       # Only written when a redaction key is provided
    manager/packet.md             # Redacted: keeps context, strips sensitive details
    public/packet.md              # Redacted: aliases repos/workstreams, strips fields
```

Date-based sources accept explicit dates or a preset:

```bash
--since 2025-07-01 --until 2026-01-01
--last-6-months
--last-quarter
--year 2025
```

Explicit `--since/--until` dates take precedence. If no date window is provided,
shiplog uses `--last-6-months`.

Use `shiplog render --latest` or `--run latest` to re-render the most recent
run. `shiplog refresh --run-dir latest` refreshes the same run while preserving
curation.

GitHub and GitLab accept `--me` to infer the source user from `--token`,
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `GITLAB_TOKEN`. Use `--user <login>` when you want to pin the
identity explicitly.

Jira and Linear use provider-specific IDs. Use `shiplog identify jira` or
`shiplog identify linear` to print the ID you should put in `shiplog.toml` or
pass to `collect`.

```

`shiplog cache` commands operate only on known source API databases under
`<out>/.cache` or `--cache-dir`: `github-api-cache.db`, `gitlab-api-cache.db`,
`jira-api-cache.db`, and `linear-api-cache.db`. `cache clean` removes expired
entries by default, `--older-than 30d` removes older entries, and `--all`
requires `--yes`. It does not delete packet artifacts, ledgers, coverage
manifests, bundles, or workstream files.

## Redaction and profiles

Internal packets do not require a redaction key. Manager and public packets fail
closed unless you provide `--redact-key` or set `SHIPLOG_REDACT_KEY`.
If a share profile is requested without a key, the CLI prints the required env
var and the `--bundle-profile` command to rerun.

Generate redacted packets by providing a key:

```bash
shiplog render --latest --redact-key my-stable-secret
```

The key drives deterministic keyed SHA-256 aliasing. Same key + same input = same aliases across runs.

| Field | Internal | Manager | Public |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| PR titles | Visible | Visible | Stripped |
| Repository names | Visible | Visible | Aliased (e.g., `repo-a7f3`) |
| URLs | Visible | Visible | Stripped |
| Workstream names | Visible | Visible | Aliased |
| Descriptions/details | Visible | Stripped | Stripped |
| Event counts and dates | Visible | Visible | Visible |

Bundle a specific profile as a zip:

```bash
shiplog render --latest --redact-key my-stable-secret --zip --bundle-profile manager
```

## Architecture

shiplog is a module-first Rust workspace following clean architecture (ports and adapters).
Public crates represent contracts, trust surfaces, real adapters, and optional dependency
boundaries; internal implementation seams live under their owning crates. See
[API_SURFACE.md](API_SURFACE.md) for the package boundary doctrine.

### Data flow

```text
GitHub API ─→ Ingestor ─→ Normalizer ─→ Clusterer ─→ Renderer ─→ Output
    │              │            │             │            │
    └── Cache      └── Schema   └── Workstreams └── Redact  └── Bundle
```

Events flow left-to-right through well-defined ports. Product boundaries are tested at the
crate level; smaller implementation seams stay as owner modules unless they earn an
external contract. Adapters depend on ports and schema, never the reverse.

### Public Surface

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `shiplog` | CLI entrypoint (clap) |
| `shiplog-engine` | Orchestration: ingest, cluster, redact, render |
| `shiplog-ports` | Trait definitions: `Ingestor`, `Renderer`, `Redactor`, `WorkstreamClusterer` |
| `shiplog-schema` | Canonical event model, `EventKind`, manifests |
| `shiplog-ids` | Deterministic SHA256-based `EventId`, `RunId`, `WorkstreamId` |
| `shiplog-coverage` | Time windows, completeness tracking |
| `shiplog-cache` | SQLite-backed API response cache |
| `shiplog-ingest-github` | GitHub PR and review ingestion with adaptive slicing |
| `shiplog-ingest-git` | Local git commit ingestion for `collect git`, `refresh git`, and `run git` |
| `shiplog-ingest-json` | Import from canonical JSON artifacts |
| `shiplog-ingest-manual` | YAML-based manual event ingestion |
| `shiplog-ingest-gitlab` | GitLab MR and review ingestion adapter |
| `shiplog-ingest-jira` | Jira issue ingestion adapter |
| `shiplog-ingest-linear` | Linear issue ingestion adapter |
| `shiplog-workstreams` | Workstream clustering and user-curated YAML workflow |
| `shiplog-merge` | Multi-source merge helpers used by the engine |
| `shiplog-cluster-llm` | Optional LLM-assisted semantic clustering |
| `shiplog-team` | Team aggregation support |
| `shiplog-redact` | Deterministic keyed SHA-256 redaction across three profiles |
| `shiplog-render-md` | Markdown packet renderer |
| `shiplog-render-json` | JSON output renderer |
| `shiplog-bundle` | Zip archives with SHA256 checksum manifests |
| `shiplog-testkit` | Shared test fixtures (not published) |

Internal implementation seams live under owner crates as modules. New boundaries
start as modules and are promoted to public crates only when they become stable
contracts, trust surfaces, real adapters, or heavy optional boundaries.
`publish = false` is reserved for dev-only packages.

## LLM clustering

By default, shiplog clusters events by repository. With the `llm` feature, you can enable semantic clustering via an OpenAI-compatible API:

```bash
# Install with LLM support
cargo install shiplog --features llm

# Use LLM clustering during collection
shiplog collect github \
  --me \
  --last-6-months \
  --out ./out \
  --llm-cluster \
  --llm-api-key $SHIPLOG_LLM_API_KEY
```

LLM clustering is feature-gated and off by default. It falls back to repository-based clustering on failure. See `--llm-api-endpoint` and `--llm-model` for endpoint configuration.
