# Legacy Shiplog Goal Manifests

This directory is archive-only. Active repo execution state now lives in
`.codex/goals/active.toml`.

This is not shiplog runtime configuration and should not be read by the
product.

Goal manifests tell Codex, Droid, or another repository agent what is actually
being worked now:

- objective;
- linked proposal, specs, ADRs, plans, and issues;
- ready work items;
- proof commands;
- stop conditions;
- archive status after completion.

## Active Goal

Do not create `.shiplog/goals/active.toml`. `cargo xtask check-goals` rejects a
legacy active manifest so agents do not split the control plane between
`.shiplog/goals` and `.codex/goals`.

Do not store secrets, tokens, private user data, or machine-local paths in goal
manifests. Use repository-relative paths and public issue or PR references.

## Archive

When a lane completes or is superseded, move the prior manifest under
`archive/` and record why. The archive is for execution history, not product
documentation.

## Relationship To Other Artifacts

Goal manifests do not define behavior. They point to the source of truth:

- proposals for why the lane exists;
- specs for behavior contracts;
- ADRs for durable architecture decisions;
- plans for sequencing and proof;
- policy ledgers for exceptions and receipts;
- guides for user-facing how-to.
