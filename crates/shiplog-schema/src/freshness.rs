//! Source freshness receipts for ingest runs.
//!
//! Each `SourceFreshness` entry attributes the cache/fetch state of one
//! source contribution within an ingest run. Adapters populate freshness
//! locally (they are the only layer that knows whether they served data
//! from cache or fetched it live); the CLI/report layer merges these
//! adapter receipts with skipped/unavailable source decisions to build
//! the final per-source freshness rollup in `intake.report.{md,json}`.
//!
//! The taxonomy is intentionally narrow in v1: `Fresh`, `Cached`, `Skipped`,
//! and `Unavailable` (see the `FreshnessStatus` enum below). A `Stale` state is reserved
//! but not emitted today because the SQLite cache filters expired rows out
//! of `ApiCache::get` (the `expires_at > now` predicate), so adapters cannot
//! honestly distinguish stale-hit from cache-miss without a new lookup
//! return type. Adding a `CacheLookup::{Fresh, Stale, Miss}` enum to
//! `shiplog-cache` is the follow-up that unlocks stale-fallback reporting.
