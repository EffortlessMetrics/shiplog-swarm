//! Source freshness receipts for ingest runs.
//!
//! Each `SourceFreshness` entry attributes the cache/fetch state of one
//! source contribution within an ingest run. Adapters populate freshness
//! locally (they are the only layer that knows whether they served data
//! from cache or fetched it live); the CLI/report layer merges these
//! adapter receipts with skipped/unavailable source decisions to build
//! the final per-source freshness rollup in `intake.report.{md,json}`.
//!
//! The taxonomy is intentionally narrow in v1: `Fresh`, `Cached`, `Skipped`,
//! `Unavailable`, and `Stale` (see the `FreshnessStatus` enum below).
//! `Stale` is emitted only when an adapter receives a proven expired cache row
//! through `shiplog-cache`'s `CacheLookup::Stale(_)` result.

/// `cache_hits` and `cache_misses` are aggregate counts across all API
